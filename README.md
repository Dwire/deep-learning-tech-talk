# Introduction to Deep Learning with The Flatiron School

Thank you for attending our Tech Talk!

In order to make use of this notebook, you'll need to make sure that you have **_Keras_** and **_TensorFlow_** installed.  

To install these packages, open up a terminal and run the following command:

`pip install keras`

This should install both Keras and TensorFlow.

To confirm that this installation worked successfully, do the following:

1.  Open a new terminal window.
1. Open the python interpreter by running `python` in the terminal.
1.  Type the following command: `import keras`

If everything installed correctly, the import statement should work, and won't throw any errors.

If the installation fails, please alert the speaker and get help, or just try googling the error message and following the instructions you see
to get everything working correctly.
